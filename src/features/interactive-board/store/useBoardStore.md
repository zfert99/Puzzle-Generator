# useBoardStore: Plain English Pseudocode

The interactive board's single source of truth — a Zustand store wrapped in the
`zundo` temporal middleware for undo/redo.

## Why Zustand + zundo

- **Zustand** lets each `Cell` subscribe (via `useShallow`) to only its own slice, so
  moving the selection or typing a digit re-renders a handful of cells, not all 81.
  This granular subscription is what keeps input latency (INP) low (research §2).
- **zundo** gives snapshot undo/redo for free. It is `partialize`d to track **only**
  `grid` and `candidates` — never the timer, status, or selection. That way a
  per-second timer tick creates no history entry, and an undo reverts a move without
  rewinding the clock (research §3.2).

## State

`grid`, `candidates` (bitmask/cell), `givens` (immutable clues), `solution`, `peers`
(precomputed), plus session state `difficulty`, `selectedCell`, `pencilMode`,
`realTimeErrors`, `status` (`configuring | playing | paused | solved`), `mode`
(`play | daily`), `dailyDate` (the daily's UTC date, or `null` for free play), `elapsedTime`,
and `mistakes` (count of wrong placements).

### Why `variant` + `cages`

`startNewGame` accepts a classic `SudokuPuzzle` *or* a `KillerPuzzle` (detected by `'cages' in
puzzle`) and records `variant: 'classic' | 'killer'` plus the `cages`. The board reads these to
render the cage overlay; `inputDigit` additionally strips a placed digit from its **cage-mates'**
pencil marks (a cage can't repeat a digit — the solution already encodes this, so a repeat still
counts as a mistake; this just keeps candidates honest). Both are persisted so a Killer resumes.

### Why `dailyDate`

Set by `startNewGame(puzzle, mode, dailyDate)` and persisted so a **resumed daily** can
restore its header and decide whether it's today's (rankable) daily or an archived/expired one
(unranked). `null` for free play. Consumed via `useSavedGame` (the save/continue descriptor).

### Why `mode`

The store is shared between `/play` and `/daily`. Persisting only `status` isn't enough
to keep the two surfaces separate: a persisted `status === 'playing'` daily would render
on `/play` (whose config gate keyed on `status` alone). `mode` records **which surface
owns the current game**, set by `startNewGame(puzzle, mode)` (defaults to `'play'`).
`PlayExperience` shows its config screen unless `status !== 'configuring' && mode === 'play'`,
so a daily never leaks onto free play — and "new game" always stays in the context you
came from. `DailyExperience` already gates on a local `phase`, so a `/play` game can't
leak the other way.

## Persistence

The store is wrapped in Zustand's `persist` middleware (key `sudoku-board`,
localStorage) so a refresh resumes the in-progress game. `partialize` saves the game
data (grid, candidates, givens, solution, difficulty, status, timer, mistakes, …) but
not `peers`, which are recomputed from `config` in `onRehydrateStorage`. `mode` is
persisted too, so a refresh keeps a daily contained to `/daily`. The store `version` is
`2` — bumped when `mode` was added, which discards any pre-`mode` persisted game on
update (a clean reset rather than a half-migrated board). Actions are dropped by JSON
serialization and re-supplied by the store creator. `persist` sits
*inside* `temporal`, so undo/redo still works and `useBoardStore.temporal` is intact.
Because the persisted state only exists on the client, `PlayExperience` gates its
first render on a mounted check to avoid an SSR/hydration mismatch.

### `resolvePeers` — self-healing against a rehydration race (July 2026)

**Why:** `config`/`status` restore synchronously as part of the persisted state merge, but
`peers` isn't persisted — it's rebuilt by the separate `onRehydrateStorage` callback, which
can run a tick *after* that merge. In that narrow window a component could technically read
a `status: 'playing'`/real `config` alongside a still-empty `peers` (`[]`, the store's initial
value). `inputDigit`/`hint` used to index straight into `peers[r * config.size + c]` and crash
("is not iterable") if that ever lined up with a real keystroke — reported once, in the wild.
`resolvePeers(peers, config)` checks `peers.length === config.size ** 2` before trusting it,
recomputing via `computePeers(config)` on the spot if it doesn't match, so a placement/hint
either uses the fast precomputed path (the common case) or self-heals for that one call
instead of throwing — never a user-visible crash either way.

## Key actions

```text
startNewGame(puzzle, mode='play'):
  load grid/solution; mark givens (cells that start non-zero); compute peers;
  status = playing; set mode (which surface owns this game); reset timer/selection;
  CLEAR undo history.

configure(): status = configuring (return to the new-game screen).

selectCell(r, c): set the selection.

inputDigit(digit):
  ignore unless playing with a selected, non-given cell.
  IF pencil mode AND the cell is empty: toggle that candidate bit.
  ELSE (pen): if the cell already holds this digit, clear it; otherwise place it —
    UNLESS all `size` instances of that digit are already on the board (lockout:
    matches the grayed-out numpad button) — clear its pencil marks, and strip the
    digit from every peer's candidates. A placement that doesn't match the solution
    increments `mistakes`. Then, if the grid equals the solution, status = solved
    (which locks the board — the play actions all require status === 'playing').

clearCell(): empty the selected non-given cell (value + candidates).

hint():
  reveal one correct cell — the selected empty cell if there is one, else the first
  empty cell. Place its value from the solution (stripping peers' candidates, same as
  a normal placement) and re-check for completion. (A strategy-aware "why" hint is a
  Phase 5 concern; this reveal-a-cell hint keeps the heavy solver out of the client.)

togglePencilMode / toggleRealTimeErrors: flip the respective flag.

tick(): +1 second, but only while playing.
pause() / resume(): toggle between playing and paused.
```

Undo/redo are read from `useBoardStore.temporal` (zundo's sibling store), not the main
store.

## BoardDifficulty and BoardPuzzle (Killer dailies)

The store's `difficulty` is a `BoardDifficulty = Difficulty | 'killer'` — the literal
`'killer'` is the daily Killer's key (free-play Killer games carry their engine difficulty
like classic). `startNewGame` accepts `BoardPuzzle`, which widens the engine puzzle types'
difficulty to `BoardDifficulty` so a daily row keyed `'killer'` starts directly. The
killer-vs-classic branch is unchanged: presence of `cages` on the puzzle object.

## `cellToCage` (cage highlighting)

A flat cell-index → cage-id map (−1 where uncaged, `[]` for classic), built once in
`startNewGame` and rebuilt from `cages` on rehydration (same derived-state treatment as
`peers` — never persisted). It exists so each cell's highlight selector can answer "same cage
as the selection?" in O(1); scanning the cage list per cell per keystroke would blow the INP
budget (AGENTS.md §3).

## `cageAnchorCell` (cage-sum clearance, July 2026)

A flat cell-index → boolean (`[]` for classic), built and rebuilt alongside `cellToCage` the
same way. Marks the one cell per cage that's its **anchor** — `Math.min(...cage.cells)`, the
same rule `computeCageOutline` (`cage-geometry.ts`) uses to place the sum label — so `Cell`
can answer "do I need to leave the top-left corner clear for a cage sum?" in O(1) instead of
scanning `cages` per render. See `Cell.md`'s "Cage-sum clearance" section for why this exists.

`BoardDifficulty` widened to `Difficulty | DailyDifficulty` — dailies store their board key
(e.g. `killer-expert`); display surfaces prettify via `formatDailyKey`.
